# Enhancing Analogical Reasoning in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus via Model-Based RL
A implementation of comparing PPO and Dreamerv3 on ARCLE environment.

To learn more:

## Experimental setting
- Actions - We used 5 operation, and entire selection
- Tasks - We selected 4 tasks that can be solved with entire selection
- 사진

## Research Question

 RQ1: Learning a Single Task
 RQ2: Reasoning about Tasks Similar to Pre-Trained Task
 RQ3: Reasoning about Sub-Tasks of Pre-Trained Task
 RQ4: Learning Multiple Tasks Simultaneously 
 RQ5: Reasoning about Merged-Tasks of Pre-Trained Tasks

In this work, we test RQ1 and RQ2

## Results

# Instructions
The code has been tested on Linux and Mac and requires Python 3.11+.
